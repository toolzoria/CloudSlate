## Flexible Grids

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on device characteristics.

## Performance Matters

Optimize images, minimize CSS and JavaScript, and use modern formats like WebP.

        content: `# Essential ES6+ JavaScript Features

Modern JavaScript has introduced many powerful features. Let's explore the most important ones.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions:

\`\`\`javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
\`\`\`

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects:

\`\`\`javascript
const { name, age } = person;
const [first, second] = array;
\`\`\`

## Template Literals

Template literals make string interpolation easier:

\`\`\`javascript
const message = \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
\`\`\`

## Async/Await

Async/await makes asynchronous code more readable:

\`\`\`javascript
async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

These features make JavaScript more powerful and easier to work with. Start using them in your projects!`,

        content: `# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they serve different purposes.

## Flexbox

Use Flexbox for:
- One-dimensional layouts (row or column)
- Aligning items within a container
- Distributing space in a single direction

## CSS Grid

Use CSS Grid for:
- Two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns)
- Complex page layouts
- Precise item placement

## When to Use Both

You can use both together! Use Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for component-level layouts.

## Conclusion

Understanding both tools gives you maximum flexibility in creating layouts.`,
